CSC513 Designing Creativity Support Tools - Lighthouse Project

## Component 1: Sun Simulator
Sun Simulator is a tangible creativity support tool developed as part of the Lighthouse project. 
It allows lighting designers, architects, and interior designers to simulate daylight conditions using an RGB LED and a programmable interface controlled via IR remote.

### Features
	•	IR remote input for intuitive interaction
	•	Smooth time lapse lighting transitions across a 24-hour cycle
	•	Manual scrubbing through hourly daylight states
	•	LCD display for system status feedback
	•	Expandable framework for future integration with spatial position sensors and motorized daylight tracking

### Components

See sun-simulator_components-list.pdf for a full list of hardware.

### Usage

Upload sunsimulator.ino to your Arduino Uno. Use the IR remote to:
	•	Power on/off
	•	Start, pause, or stop a timelapse
	•	Scrub through specific hours
	•	View system status on the LCD
