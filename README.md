### Physical Design: Vehicle Housing

The physical layout of the vehicle housing—including component placement for the MPU6050, battery, NodeMCU, and wiring channels—was prototyped in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

- The model includes:
  - Component slots and clearances for each board/module
  - Cable routing paths
  - Magnet mounting positions for frame
  - Alignment with laser-cut parts
  - Air vents for electronics heat management

See [Rendering A](./A2/hardware/photos/vehicle_rendering_A.png) and [Rendering B](./A2/hardware/photos/vehicle_rendering_B.png) for static renderings of the final design before preparing the laser cut [pattern](./A2/hardware/laser_cut).

Component color key:
- Dark Purple: NodeMCU 
- Blue: Boost converter
- Magenta: LiPo 
- Yellow: MPU 
- Brown: Charging Module

This prototype was used to inform final dimensions and component placement strategies. Glueing and fastening strategies were implemented when designing the cut pattern in Adobe Illustrator.
